## howto

```
python data_generator.py
python network_trainer.py
python result_predictor.py <b> <c> 
```

## example

```
python result_predictor.py 3 1
```

## required libs

```
- pandas
- numpy
```

it is assumed that the dataset is normalized with respect to a, so the equations stick to the following format: x^2+bx+c=0  
Notice, that all input labels start with "i" and all output labels start with "o"
